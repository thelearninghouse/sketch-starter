# Sketch Starter

A very minimal starter template for sketch.

## Requirements

- [Kactus](https://kactus.io/)
- [Anima Toolkit Sketch Plugin](https://www.animaapp.com/) (Technically not required, but some symbols use it to auto-resize)

## Notes

- The mobile artboard is set to the iPhone 8 size to show properly with Sketch Mirror. It also has a hidden viewport guide, which can help with aligning sticky items on the edge of the screen
- Anima stacks seem to resize best when entering an exact dimension into the inspector instead of dragging a handle
